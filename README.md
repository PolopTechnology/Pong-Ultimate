# Pong-Ultimate

Helloooo! This is our Pong Ultimate Game!
It's basically the same one from the 70's but a slight change in mechanics.

In THIS version, the paddle moves by itself and the players need to stop it at the right time to hit the ball.
We are working on a BETTER version (coming soon)

Also, we will soon release a version of the game so that programmers can learn how we did it!
See, we here at Polop Technologies don't want to JUST make games for people to play, but to also ALLOW other people who want to make games to learn how.

So yeah, that is basically all that we have to say. We hope you enjoy our game and pay attention to other games!
Now... Bye!
